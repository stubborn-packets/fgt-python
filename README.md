# Welcome

My name is Josh and I am a Network Engineer who, like many of us, are moving into the journey of Network Automation. I work a lot with Meraki, Cisco OS and FortiNet and traditionally used the CLI almost exclusively. As I take on this journey of moving toward a Network Automation approach, I am planning to create some tutorials along the way which hopefully can help some of you. Some of them will be from projects that I have worked on or something that I think will spark that interest in Network Automation. I'm going to try and use real world examples of tasks that can be done with Network Automation as that is where I started once I saw how fast things could be done when working on a specific task.

I don't traditionally write blogs so forgive my writing style. I like to have fun while coding and so I might throw in some jokes here and there. Hopefully you enjoy the material and if you have any questions, please let me know.


Thanks,

***Josh***
